			In these projects, we collaborate with schools that are being run for underprivileged children to take overall development sessions.
			These sessions include inculcating in them the importance of dreams,
			and how can they achieve their goals, safety and also to promote health and hygiene amongst the kids.
			Araatrika is the project for underprivileged adolescent females, with the focus being laid upon their health.
			Sammaan is the project wherein the focus stays upon inculcating equality for both the genders,
			to teach kids how to respect the other gender.</p>

			In the month of March, we decided to focus on enabling people suffering from physical and mental
			disabilities. We made multiple visits to institutions like Deepashram , which cater to such individuals
			and tried to address the issues faced by them. In addition to that, we organised some fun activities for
			them to enjoy. This monthly theme format allows us to cater to a wider range of society in an efficient
			manner and allows us to identify new areas where we can be of assistance.</p>
