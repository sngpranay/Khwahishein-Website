# Khwahishein-Website

This is a website I designed and developed for the The Khwahishien Foundation in Delhi. To add minimilistic design animations I used Prinzhorn's awesome Skrollr library that lets you add great parallax effects. I also used to used Twitter Bootstrap to take advantage of their easy to use grid. Shoutout to unsplash.com for providing high resolution hero images !
